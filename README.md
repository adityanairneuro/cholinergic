Cholinergic modulation has long been thought to alter the signal-to-noise ratio of neural circuits. We discovered a logic for how cholinergic co-release of acetylcholine and GABA alter properties of neurons in the claustrum. We invesigate the effects of this cholinergic mechanism on SNR of a claustrum network modelled as a stability-optimised-circuit <a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. More information can be found in our paper. 

This repo contains code to reproduce all figures related to cholinergic modulation of our claustrum network model
