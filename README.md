Cholinergic modulation has long been thought to alter the signal-to-noise ratio of neural circuits. We discovered a logic for how cholinergic co-release of acetylcholine and GABA alter properties of neurons in the claustrum. We invesigate the effects of this cholinergic mechanism on SNR of a claustrum network modelled as a stability-optimised-circuit<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. More information can be found in our paper. 

This repo contains code to reproduce all figures related to cholinergic modulation of our claustrum network model. Please add all files to your path in Matlab before running the code.
